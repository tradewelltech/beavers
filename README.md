# Beavers

[Beavers][1] is a python library for stream processing, optimized for analytics. 

It is used at [Tradewell Technologies][2], 
to calculate analytics and serve model predictions,
for both realtime and batch jobs.

## Key Features

- Works in **real time** (eg: reading from Kafka) and **replay mode** (eg: reading from Parquet files).
- Optimized for analytics, using micro-batches (instead of processing records one by one).
- Similar to [incremental][3], it updates nodes in a dag incrementally.
- Taking inspiration from [kafka streams][4], there are two types of nodes in the dag:
    - **Stream**: ephemeral micro-batches of events (cleared after every cycle).
    - **State**: durable state derived from streams.
- Clear separation between the business logic and the IO. 
  So the same dag can be used in real time mode, replay mode or can be easily tested.
- Functional interface: no inheritance or decorator required.
- Support for complicated joins, not just "linear" data flow.

## Limitations

- No concurrency support. 
  To speed up calculation use libraries like pandas, pyarrow or polars.
- No async code.
  To speed up IO use kafka driver native thread or parquet IO thread pool.
- No support for persistent state. 
  Instead of saving state, replay historic data from kafka to prime stateful nodes.
