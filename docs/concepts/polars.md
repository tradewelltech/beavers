# Polars integration

This section explains how to use beavers with polars.

## ETF value calculation example

In this example we want to calculate the value of ETFs.

Starting with a data frame of individual share prices:
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:business_logic_price"
```

| ticker   |   price |
|:---------|--------:|
| AAPL     |  174.79 |
| GOOGL    |  130.25 |
| MSFT     |  317.01 |
| F        |   12.43 |
| GM       |   35.28 |

And another data frame containing the composition of each ETF:
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:business_logic_composition"
```

| etf   | ticker   |   quantity |
|:------|:---------|-----------:|
| TECH  | AAPL     |        2.0 |
| TECH  | GOOGL    |        2.0 |
| TECH  | MSFT     |        1.0 |
| CARS  | F        |        3.0 |
| CARS  | GM       |        1.0 |

In a few line of `polars` we can derive the value of each ETF:
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:business_logic_calculation"
```

| etf  |   value |
|:-----|--------:|
| TECH |  927.09 |
| CARS |   72.57 |

## ETF value calculation DAG

Once the business logic of the calculation is writen and tested it can be added into a Dag.
We'll be using the Dag `pl` helper which makes it easier to deal with `polars` data frame in beavers.

First we define two source streams, made of `polars.DataFrame`:
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:dag_source"
```

Then we keep track of the latest value for each source stream:
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:dag_state"
```

Lastly we put together the share prices and ETF composition:
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:dag_calculation"
```

And that's it:

```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:dag_test"
```


## Taming updates

This simple dag does the job of calculating the ETF value in real time.
But there is one issue.
The value of every ETF would update every time either `price` or `etf_composition` update.
Even if the updates comes on a ticker that is not relevant to the ETFs we are tracking. 

In the example below, when the price of GameStop updates, we recalculate the value of every ETF.
Even though their value hasn't changed:
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:spurious_update"
```

To tame updates we need to identify which ETF needs updating.

ETF values can update because their composition has changed:
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:updated_because_of_composition"
```

Or because one of their component has updated: 
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:updated_because_of_price"
```

We can then put it back together and only calculate updates for relevant ETFs:
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:update_all"
```


And see that only the value "TECH" ETF updates when a tech stock update:
```python
--8<-- "examples/polars_concepts.py:update_all_test"
```

| etf   |   value |
|:------|--------:|
| TECH  |  927.13 |
